# My-Project
This will be the repository where I will store all of the ideas, information, and resources for my Front End project for Code Louisville.

My project will be to develop a comprehensive website that will share information about camping and hiking in Red River Gorge. The website will be a resource for people who have never been to RRG or have limited information about places where they can camp and hike. In order to stay within the project requirements, the website will focus on camping and hiking but if I'm able to successfully execute what I'm supposed to, my vision is to expand with broader information on rock climbing, cycling, paddling, etc.
